This is release 3.1.0 of the hesinfo program, which is a simple
command-line interface to the Hesiod nae service library.

To prepare this directory for building, run the command "./configure".
configure takes a number of options; use "./configure --help" to find
out what they are.  Hesiod requires a vaguely ANSI compiler to build;
gcc will do.

Run "make" or "make all" to build hesinfo.

Run "make install" to install hesinfo.
